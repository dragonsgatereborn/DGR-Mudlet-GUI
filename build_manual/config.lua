## DGR GUI package with EMCO chat

This package includes EMCO for tabbed chat and provides a DGRGUI parent structure for scripts, aliases, and triggers.

It's built using an adjustable container, so it can be moved, resized, etc right out of the box. There are aliases with the package which make adding/removing tabs and changing some of the basic themes of the EMCO easier.

You can leverage the entire [EMCO API](https://demonnic.github.io/mdk/current/classes/EMCO.html) by targeting `demonnic.chat`, as that is the actual underlying EMCO object.

## Installation

You can use the following command in Mudlet to install the latest version:

`lua installPackage("https://github.com/dragonsgatereborn/DGR-Mudlet-GUI/releases/latest/download/DGRGUI.mpackage")`

Once you have it installed you can update by using the `emco update` alias.

## Usage

### Copying lines into your EMCO

If you want to copy a line from the game and send it to EMCO, make a trigger to match the line, and use `demonnic.chat:append("tabName")` to copy the line to the EMCO. For instance, to send a line to the "Tells" tab, you would use

```lua
demonnic.chat:append("Tells")
```

If you want to send lines to the EMCO in code yourself, you can use `demonnic.chat:cecho("OOC", "This is an OOC message\n")`. There is also decho and hecho available the same way.
